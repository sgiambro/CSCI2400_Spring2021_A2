Goals: Create a program that can sort an array of random numbers from least to greatest

Input: swap() gets the two int* elements that need to be swaped
       values[] will recive a random number for each elememt in the array from ranArray()	

Output: print all the versions of the array while its being sorted
	print finished array
	sort() tells which int* elements need to be swaped
	ranArray() will create and send the number to an element in the global values[] array

Steps:
	printValues()
		- create a for loop that runs through the values array
		- each cycle will print an element in the array

	sort()
		- implement the bubble sorting algorithm
		- call the swap() function to switch the two elements identified
		- keep repeting until the array is sorted 

	swap()
		- get the two constant int* elements and assign one to a temp variable
		- swap on element with the other one then use the temp variable to complete the swap

	ranArray()
		-create variable that will hold the random number
		-set a seed for the random numbers
		-create a random number from 1-100
		-send it to the global array values[]

	main()
		- print the origional array 
		- sort using sort()
		- then print the sorted array
